# Spectra-Mirror

The Spectra Mirror is an analog downsampler with a bunch of bells and whistles not found in other downsamplers.
The module is currently discontinued but is now available in an open hardware licence for those who still want
to build one.  Most of the well known DIY synth retailers as of now still have a few boards in stock, so if you
would like to build one without going through the process of getting the boards made yourself go ahead and
check them out, currently thonk, modular addict and synthcube all have them in stock.

The entire build is through hole with easy to find parts, there is one optional SMD matched transistor pair for 
those wanting superior tracking of the internal VCO.  I would say that this project is not for a complete beginner 
but would be quite easy for anyone with a fair amount of DIY experience.  The calibration procedure requires at 
least a multimeter and benefits from the use of an oscilloscope, although again this is not crucial.  Please read 
the build documentation if you want a better idea of the level of difficulty for the build.

========= FOR THOSE ATTEMPTING THE MATCHED TRANSISTOR PAIR =========

The following parts will be needed.  I am specifically making you source them as a "barrier for entry" as doing 
this matched transistor pair is not for DIY beginners.  SMD soldering aptitude is required.

Transistor pair is by diodes incorporated part # ZXTC2045E6TA

You will also need a 22k resistor and a 22nF capacitor.
